THIS MODULE SHOWS A SCROLLING BAR OF IMAGES = The Expose scroller module for Joomla 1.0.x and 1.5.x, moves a specified quantity of Expose gallery photos from one or all albums in horizontal or vertical direction over your website.
	You can check out a demo of the effect produced in our official demo site http://expose.modus.ie/.
	There are two ways to point the scroller to its pictures:
	You can defign a thumbnailpath (directory located from Joomlaroot). This will disable the link to picture option, but enable to look also for pictures in subdirectories.
	Or you have Expose RC3+ component installed (but we advise to update to the latest version), install this module and set the parameters below like you want. Don't forget to publish it! This will disable the search in subalbums, but enable the possibility to link to the picture.
	Without changing anything on the default settings, the scroller will loop horizontal from right to the left with 10 random photos from your Expose gallery.
	LICENSE
	You may use this software free of charge. This software uses ShadowBox (by Michael J. I. Jackson) and Continuous Scroll Banner (by Vic Phillips) scripts.
